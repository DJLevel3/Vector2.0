# Vector2.0

At the moment, this is just a repository to house my barely-working, low-comment code, but in the future it'll be a full-featured vector-ish racing game.

As of 04/22/2021, the Makefile is just an auto-generated one, so it probably won't work. Just execute the file ./Debug/Vector2.0 to get into the current state of the game.
